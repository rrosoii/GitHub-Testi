<h1>Diane Nguyen</h1>
<p>Diane is considerably compassionate and empathetic, especially towards friends of hers such as
     Todd and BoJack, even when dragged into BoJack's shenanigans.
      However, she occasionally struggles to balance this empathy with her tendency to believe that her way of doing things is
       the only correct way.</p>
