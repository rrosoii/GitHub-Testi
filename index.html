<h1>Bojack Horseman</h1>
<p>BoJack Horseman is the washed-up star of the fictional 1990s sitcom Horsin' Around, which
     centered around a young bachelor horse trying to raise three human children who had been orphaned. 
     Now living in relative obscurity in his Hollywood Hills mansion, BoJack plans a monumental
     comeback to celebrity relevance with 
     a tell-all autobiography to be written by ghostwriter Diane Nguyen. At the same time, he deals with his
      addiction to alcohol and other drugs,
      and the resulting recklessness.</p>
