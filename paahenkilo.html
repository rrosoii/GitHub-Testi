<h1>Bojack Horseman</h1>
<p>BoJack Horseman is bitter, depressed, self-loathing, narcissistic, and self-destructive.
    Despite these struggles and insecurities that he has, BoJack does care about others, such as his friends,
     can even be insightful, doesn't really want to hurt anybody, and has proven to be more tender-hearted than he appears to be.
